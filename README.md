# Github Getter

## Overview

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows users to search through Github repositories via keyword.

- Write your app using either a) "vanilla" javascript or b) React.js. Lodash (included).
- Do not spend more than four (4) hours on this task.
- Some files have been created for you in advance â€“ `app.js`, `styles.css` and `index.html`.
- `index.html` contains three elements: one for the search term, one for the results, and one for an overlay.
- Search results should display as a list. Each list item should display the repository's _name_ and _owner_.
- When a result is clicked/tapped, please display the repository's _language_, _followers_, _url_ and _description_.
- UI presentation and search UX is up to you.
- Build for the latest version of Chrome only.
- And lastly, please follow up with some thoughts on where you would take this feature further. For example, maybe you'd refine the UI or process github data differently. Add these thoughts to the README.
